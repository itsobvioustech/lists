## Multi-chain token list 
We collect many tokenlists from many providers, then we aggregate them by chains and tokens addresses. 
For each token we check whether it is listed in 2 or more tokenlists from different providers. If so, 
we add it to our trusted tokenlist.

## Providers
We collect tokenlists from github repos or open APIs from various platforms, currently:
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)
- [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/)
- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)
- [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/)
- [OpenOcean](https://openocean.finance/)
- [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)
